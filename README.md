Salary Allocation App
The Salary Allocation App is a Flask-based web application that helps users allocate their salary effectively using budgeting principles. It combines traditional budgeting rules (e.g., the 50/30/20 rule) with a machine learning model to provide personalized recommendations tailored to each user's financial situation.

How It Works
User Inputs: Enter salary, expenses, and savings goals.
ML-Driven Recommendations: The app uses a machine learning model to analyze inputs and predict optimal salary allocation based on past trends and user profiles.
QR Code Generation: Outputs a QR code with the personalized allocation for easy sharing.

Machine Learning Model
The app uses a random forest  model trained on financial data to:
Predict optimal allocations for needs, wants, and savings.
Provide actionable, personalized budgeting advice.
Adjust recommendations dynamically based on user inputs.

Features
Budget allocation breakdown (e.g., needs, wants, savings).
QR code sharing for allocation details.
Personalized insights powered by machine learning.

This app is designed to simplify financial planning and empower users to achieve their savings goals efficiently.
